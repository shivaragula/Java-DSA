# 🧠 Java DSA Progress Log

## 📅 Day 1 
- ✅ Initialized Java DSA repository on GitHub
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - 🔁 Basic Array Iteration using For Loop
  - 🌀 Merge Sort implementation
  - ❌ Remove all occurrences of an element from array
- 
- 📘 Learned:
  - Java for-each and loop constructs
  - Divide and conquer recursion flow in Merge Sort
  - In-place removal logic using a second pointer
## 📅 Day 2 
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - ❌ Remove Element from Array (in-place)
  - 🧹 Remove Duplicates in Sorted Array (allow once)
  - 🗳️ Find Majority Element (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
-
- 📘 Learned:
  - Efficient in-place array updates using two pointers (`left`, `right`)
  - How to track majority using a counter instead of HashMap
  - Real-world coding patterns like overwrite & skip strategies

  ## 📅 Day 3 
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - 🔄 Rotate Array (Right shift using reversal method)
  - 📈 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Single Transaction)
  - 📈 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Multiple Transactions)
- 📘 Learned:
  - Efficient array rotation using reverse logic instead of extra space
  - Using a running minimum and profit tracker for optimal buy-sell timing
  - Greedy approach to maximize multiple transactions over price spikes

## 🔁  DSA Practice – Solved 4 Problems
- 📊 H-Index – Using sorting approach
- 📊 H-Index – Using counting/bucket approach
- 🏃 Jump Game I – Can reach the last index (Greedy strategy)
- 🪜 Jump Game II – Minimum number of jumps to reach the end

📘 Learned:
- How sorting and counting trade off in performance and complexity
- Applied greedy logic to optimize pathfinding in array-based jumps
- Strengthened array traversal and edge-case reasoning

👨‍💻 Day 5 – Java DSA Practice

Today, I focused on two key areas to strengthen my fundamentals and problem-solving ability:

✅ Revisited Core OOP Concepts in Java:

Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

Implemented class-based logic for real understanding

✅ Solved the RandomizedSet problem:

Designed a data structure that supports insert(), remove(), and getRandom() in O(1) time

Used a combination of HashMap and ArrayList to achieve constant time operations
