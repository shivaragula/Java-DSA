# 🧠 Java DSA Progress Log

## 📅 Day 1 – July 4, 2025
- ✅ Initialized Java DSA repository on GitHub
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - 🔁 Basic Array Iteration using For Loop
  - 🌀 Merge Sort implementation
  - ❌ Remove all occurrences of an element from array
- 📁 Added:
  - Arrays/ArrayProblems.java
  - Arrays/Day1_RemoveElement.java
  - Sorting/Day1_MergeSort.java
- 📘 Learned:
  - Java for-each and loop constructs
  - Divide and conquer recursion flow in Merge Sort
  - In-place removal logic using a second pointer
## 📅 Day 2 – July 5, 2025
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - ❌ Remove Element from Array (in-place)
  - 🧹 Remove Duplicates in Sorted Array (allow once)
  - 🗳️ Find Majority Element (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
- 📁 Added:
  - Arrays/Day2_RemoveElement.java
  - Arrays/Day2_RemoveDuplicates.java
  - Arrays/Day2_MajorityElement.java
- 📘 Learned:
  - Efficient in-place array updates using two pointers (`left`, `right`)
  - How to track majority using a counter instead of HashMap
  - Real-world coding patterns like overwrite & skip strategies

  ## 📅 Day 3 – July 6, 2025
- ✅ Solved 3 problems:
  - 🔄 Rotate Array (Right shift using reversal method)
  - 📈 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Single Transaction)
  - 📈 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Multiple Transactions)
- 📘 Learned:
  - Efficient array rotation using reverse logic instead of extra space
  - Using a running minimum and profit tracker for optimal buy-sell timing
  - Greedy approach to maximize multiple transactions over price spikes
